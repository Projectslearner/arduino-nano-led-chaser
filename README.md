# LED Chaser with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

The LED chaser project, also known as a "Knight Rider" effect, creates a chasing pattern with a series of LEDs. In this project, an Arduino Nano is used to control the LEDs, making them turn on and off sequentially in a chasing pattern.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **6 LEDs**
3. **Resistors (220Ω)**
4. **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **LED Connections:**
   - Connect each LED to digital pins 2 to 7 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Use 220Ω resistors to limit the current to each LED.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the LEDs and resistors to the Arduino Nano as described above and shown in the circuit diagram.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the LEDs creating a chasing pattern, where they turn on and off sequentially in both directions.

#### Applications

- **Decoration:** Use the LED chaser effect for decorative lighting in various projects.
- **Signage:** Implement LED chaser patterns for attention-grabbing signs or displays.

#### Notes

- Adjust the delay value to change the speed of the chasing pattern.
- Experiment with different LED configurations and patterns to create unique effects.
